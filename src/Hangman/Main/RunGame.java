/**
 *  THIS WILL RUN THE GAME LOGIC. KEEPING TRACK OF THE ANSWER, NUMBER OF GUESSES, GUESSES MADE,
 *  AND PROGRESS IN GUESSING THE WORD.
 * 
 *   1. During the game it prints out whether the currently guessed letter is in the word by printing
 *      "you missed: LETTER not in word", where LETTER is replaced by the letter the user guess.
 * 
 *   2. When the game is over according to processUserGuess, it determines if the user won or not,
 *      prints out the corresponding text: 
 *      
 *      If the user won, it prints out "you guessed the word: " + secretWord.
 *      If the user lost, it prints out "GAME OVER" and then on a new line "word is " + secretWord.
 * 
 *   3. After printing out whether the user won, it also prints "you made GUESSES guesses with MISSES misses"
 *      where GUESSES is the number of guesses by the user and MISSES is the number of misses by the user.
 *      
 *      Your code can keep track of the number of misses as the game is played, or it can calculate the number
 *      of misses at the end by subtracting the number of misses left from the total number of misses allowed.
 * 
 *      Returns: Type: bool
 *      Returns True if the user won the game and False otherwise.

     * processUserGuess(guessedLetter, secretWord, hangmanWord, missesLeft) -- 
Takes the user's guess, the secret word, the user's current progress on the word, and the number of misses left and updates the current game state of hangmanWord, number of misses left, and whether the user missed.

Parameters:

guessedLetter (type: string) - the user's current guess, represented as a string of length 1, the return value of handleUserInputLetterGuess
secretWord (type: string) - the secret word returned by getWord
hangmanWord (type: list of strings) - represents the currently displayed hangman, each element in the list represents a letter in the secret word and it is either the actual letter or "_" representing that the user has not yet guessed that letter
missesLeft (type: int) - the number of misses the user has left

Returns:

Type: list

A list with the following at each index:

Index 0: (type: list of strings) the "new" hangmanWord based on the user's guess in guessedLetter, it should use the helper function updateHangmanWord to do this.
Index 1: (type: int) an updated value for missesLeft based on the user's guess in guessedLetter
Index 2: (type: bool) indication of whether the user made a correct guess, where True means the user guessed a letter in the word and False means the user missed
